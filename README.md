# PE-Predictor

This project focuses on the early prediction of complications from Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), specifically Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Using a Random Forest algorithm, the model analyzes modifiable risk factors like age, gender, blood oxygen levels, temperature, and heart rate. The AI model achieved 92.3% accuracy in predicting PE complications. By integrating the model with wearable technology, the project offers a promising solution for early detection and prevention, potentially reducing the risks associated with VTE complications.
